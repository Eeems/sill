Welcome to XXX!

XXX is an editor for plain-text files.
Unusually, you edit the text by writing directly on the
screen.

## About templates

XXX is a "template-based" ???.
For every character it knows about, it has a list of
templates.
When you write a character on the grid, it checks its
list of templates. Whatever template looks the most
similar to the algorithm, it returns.
